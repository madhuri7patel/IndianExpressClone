# Masai School Construct Week Project

Welcome, we're are team ‚ÄúIndian Express‚Äù, and this Readme contains details about our project. We‚Äòve built a cloned website of Indian Express with some of its basic functionalities. This overall project was a part of our construct week at Masai School.



## About Project
At a time when India was struggling for her freedom, oppression was rife and the press virtually gagged, one voice dared to break the silence. Founded by Shri Ramnath Goenka in 1932, The Indian Express gave India a voice of opinion that was fearless and true.

<b> And we cloned it for our construct week Project. </b>

<h2>Here are some screen-shots from our website</h2>
